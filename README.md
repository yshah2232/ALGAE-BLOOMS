# ALGAE-BLOOMS

Prediction of Algae blooms

Issue:
A lake full of a layer of algae and even with mechanical means it cannot be removed. What can be done to remove it completely?
It is a serious ecological problem with a strong impact not only on aquatic lifeforms, but also on water quality.

Goal:
Being able to monitor and perform an early forecast of algae blooms is essential to improving the quality of rivers. With the goal of addressing this prediction problem

DATASET
There are two datasets to be precise 
One with 200 water samples and other with 140 water samples
Each data set includes 11 variables
3 to describe the season of the year
Remaining 8 variables are values of chemical parameters

Models Used
Multiple Linear Regression Models
Linear Regression Model

conclusion
Decision trees provide an effective method of Decision Making because they: Clearly lay out the problem so that all options can be challenged. Allow us to analyze fully the possible consequences of a decision.
We can use this decision making to get better prediction which will be useful in keeping check the algae blooms
With which we can save the lives of many Aquatic animals and stopping many species from becoming enxtinct
